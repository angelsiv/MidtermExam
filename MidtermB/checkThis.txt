hi
i think i would have liked more time

- i tried to do the client to rotate towards the First person character using a task in the BT.
- started event hit on the client, very unpolished

- finished widget bp for entry point: not so polished as i want to
- wasn't sure if i needed billboard effect so didn't do it

- started widgetbp for client count: not connected to actual player variables so not functioning :(
